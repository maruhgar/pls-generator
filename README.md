This web application provides an interface for users to browse media folders and create playlists, which can then be passed to Shoutcast server to be played.

This allows multiple users to share music in the intranet (or even internet) subject to necessary copyrights.

This is based on (to be precise, enhancement) to a similar application (shoutcast-jukebox) created by my friend and ex-colleague Bosky.
